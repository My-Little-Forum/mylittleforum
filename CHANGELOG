2.4.21 (2020-04-25)
-------------------

- fixed: image URLs in the RSS-feed was specified with only the local, relative path on the domain, we do need a complete URl with protocol, domain and path because the feed reader requests the feed from outside the domain

2.4.18.1 (2019-01-14)
---------------------

- change: changed the language strings, key: show_spam_link, for english and german language, led to danger of confusion ("show spam (no. of entries)" vs. "list spam") (enahncement for admins and mods)
